## 2. Product Overview
💬 _Provides background and context influencing the product’s requirements._

### 2.1 Product Perspective
💬 _Places the product within a larger ecosystem or lineage._

➥ Describe context and origin of the product, whether this is a new product, replacement, or member of a family. If part of a larger system, briefly explain relationships, external interfaces, and key dependencies. Include details on ownership, service level agreements (SLAs), and support models.

💡 Tips:
- Highlight upstream/downstream systems and ownership boundaries.
- A high-level context diagram may help to orient the reader.

### 2.2 Product Functions
💬 _High-level summary of what the product enables users or systems to do._

➥ Provide a concise overview of the major functional areas/features. Defer detailed behaviors, data, and edge cases to Section 3.

💡 Tips:
- 5–10 bullets are often sufficient at this level, grouping related functions logically.
- Include a top-level data flow or use case diagram if helpful.

### 2.3 Product Constraints
💬 _Defines limitations or conditions shaping design and implementation._

➥ Describe constraints such as mandated interfaces, technology stacks, regulatory obligations, QoS baselines, hardware limitations, AI/ML model families, and organizational policies.

💡 Tips:
- State constraints as verifiable "must" statements (e.g., “must use FIPS 140–3 validated crypto modules”).
- Distinguish external/internal and mandatory/preferred constraints.
- Avoid design decisions unless truly binding.

📝 Note:
Requirements (Section 3) defines verifiable system obligations—specific behaviors or qualities the system shall exhibit in order to satisfy limits described in this section.

### 2.4 User Characteristics
💬 _Defines the user groups and the attributes that affect requirements._

➥ Identify user classes, roles, and personas, noting expertise, access levels, frequency of use, accessibility needs, and goals.

💡 Tips:
- Define user classes by behavior, not just titles.
- Note localization and accessibility considerations that affect UI/UX requirements.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
💬 _External assumed factors or conditions, as opposed to known facts, that the project relies on._

➥ List assumptions about environment, hardware, usage patterns, third-party components/services, and organizational support. List dependencies on external systems, libraries, or teams. For each, indicate potential impact if proven false.

💡 Tips:
- Link assumptions to risk register with owner and mitigation when available.

### 2.6 Apportioning of Requirements
💬 _Allocation of requirements across components or increments._

➥ Map major requirements to subsystems, services, or releases/iterations. Use a cross-reference table to show allocation and to clearly identify deferred requirements.

💡 Tips:
- Note unknown allocations explicitly and track as follow-ups.
