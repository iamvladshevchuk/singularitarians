### 3.2 Functional
ðŸ’¬ _Specifies the externally observable behaviors and functions the software shall provide._

âž¥ Organize functional requirements by feature, use case, or service. For each, describe triggers/inputs, processing/logic (at a black-box level), outputs, and error conditions. For AI behaviors, define determinism bounds (e.g., temperature), refusal criteria, safety rules, and human review points.

ðŸ’¡ Tips:
- Include edge cases and negative scenarios for completeness.
- For AI features, include fallback behaviors and thresholds for abstention.
